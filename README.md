#Here is a clean, professional README.md file for your project. This will help you or anyone else understand how the code works and how to set it up.

💖 Valentine’s Proposal Webpage
A playful, interactive "Will You Be My Valentine?" web application built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. It features a "No" button that dodges the cursor, custom teasing messages, and a celebratory "Heart Storm" once the user accepts.

✨ Features
Dodging "No" Button: The "No" button moves randomly within the card when hovered or clicked, making it "impossible" to select.

Dynamic Teasing Messages: A custom 8-step message sequence appears every time the "No" button is clicked:

"This is not right!"

"Don’t press again!"

...up to "I will Start Again".

System Reboot Loop: On the 9th click, the system simulated a "restart," resetting the buttons and messages.

Persuasive "Yes" Button: Every time the user attempts to click "No," the "Yes" button grows larger and more inviting.

Success Celebration: Upon clicking "Yes," the layout expands, reveals secret details (Date, Time, Key, Code), and triggers a continuous floating heart animation.

Responsive Design: Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
